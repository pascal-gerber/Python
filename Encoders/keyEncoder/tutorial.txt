This programm can only encrypt and decrypt texts that are only encoded on this programm, it may or may not be able to decode
others.
altho it might be possible for future upgrades to be decoding more than that.

it works by changing the whole text as a binary worth
step 1: Addition
step 2: Multiplication
step 3: Substraction

the key is within the encoded text.
the programm is able to read the key and use it to decode the sended text.
mostly it is all automatic.

IMPORTANT NOTE
python has a limit of 1114111 Chars, char worths highter than that, will cause an error.
so mostly it is best to only use 2 digit numbers, but if you understand or want to try it out.
youre free to as you wish

PS: dont come complaining after messing up with the program-
