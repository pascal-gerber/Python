This is the python Library.
The Bat file should open the file explorer and make it easier for you "the user" to navigate and find what you search
This program was purposefully made to teach you python.


Currently it is being worked on but sooner or later it will be a fully filled library.

Note: Works on Pydroid on Smartphones "as i know android":
Android does not open the file in a compiler, it simply shows the files content on a new window.
