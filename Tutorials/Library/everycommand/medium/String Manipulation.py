#in strings theres a sign you can use to make changes in the text
#as you know ' and " work the same, you can tho print both in one string
#whitout needing to close the string or anything

first = "this works fine => ' "
second = 'this too => " '
#these work whitout adding anything

#when adding a \ sign behind any special sign, it will only print the special sign
#removing any of its previous functionnality commands.
both = " this \" and this ' both work "

#when \n it will in the place cut and go to next line
print(first + "\n" + second + "\n" + both)

#of course you can use another syntax too
threeline = """Multi
Line
Syntax"""

#3 of the signs either ' or " will create a multiline string until its closed
#heres how it looks like
print(threeline)


#more you will find around
