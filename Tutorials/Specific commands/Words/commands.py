while #is a loop that will loop the content until some specific goal has been
      #archieved. can also be an eternal loop.

for #is a loop like while but will have a changable value and an end in one line

continue #will skip one loop or the rest if it 
break #will stop the whole loop

#values as booleans
True
False

#empty value
None

#kind of language stuff
and
not
or

is #==

#can be related in opening files but also can be alone.
with
as

#will try, and do the other if an error occurs
try
except
finally

#will look if the statement is true, elif an other is true will do the other or
#else will do if none of the above is true
if
elif
else

pass #does nothing, just prevents error messages if a function is empty

#note: try and if almost have the same use except that try is for errors.


lambda #will fix value issues and usually make loops more bug resistant.

def #will create a function with certain pieces of codes.
global #will make a value accessible also from outside
return #will give a certain value if the function itself is printed or asked

#are both used for importing, the from is usually here to import certain functions from a module.
import
from
#syntax : " from tkinter import * "

del #can delete objects from lists.

class #creates a class that has certain values for certain other values.
