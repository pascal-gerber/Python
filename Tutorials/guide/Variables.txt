Variables can be different types but they always gonna be the main ones.

anything that has a value/number is a variable even if its a simple function or a coordinate.
they are usually lists or tuples.
so any value is changable if you look at the end value and its "Type".

some values can only be reached if converted twice like 

#
str(int(True))
#

which whould give another value if directly converted into a string.

sometimes the variable can contain an other type of object than a variabletype, it can be either a button or a server itself, can be a gui window or anything really.

Good luck!
