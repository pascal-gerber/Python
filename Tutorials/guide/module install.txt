for installing modules i recommand always use the syntax :

#
python -m pip install #modulename
python -m pip install keyboard
#

since it will install much more properly than the normal pip install.

also for the pip update which is then very important

#
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
#

which can in most cases prevent issues.

sometimes modules wont work since theyre open source and sometimes they can also be dangerous, always look out what you download.

Good luck!
